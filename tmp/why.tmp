This folder is used by void.php to store temporary data or to cache
things like the class index (autoload-cache) or templates.

The tmp/ directory and it's subfolders have to be writable by the php
process.

You can delete the contents of this directory if you want, but they
might be recreated automaticly as soon as the php scripts get called.
