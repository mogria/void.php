# Things you should already know

## HTML & CSS

If you don't know HTML & CSS you're definitely at the wrong place.

## PHP & OOP

You should understand how PHP works and know how to programm object oriented.

## MVC

You should basicly know what MVC is, because void.php is based on the MVC pattern. At least take a look at the [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC)

# Installation

To install this you first need to download the source. You can either download an archive file from the start page, or clone the git repo over @ github.

## Downloading the archive

Go to the start pagea and select the proper archive type in the download section. If you have sucessfully downloaded the archive file, extract it somewhere inside the webroot.
Navigate the browser to the location you have extracted the archive. And here you have it ;-).

## Cloning the git-repository

Simply enter this command into your command line to download void.php

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/mogria/void.php

The `--recursive` parameter is needed, because void.php uses git submodules (git repositories inside of git repositories)..
